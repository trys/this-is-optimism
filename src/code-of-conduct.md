# Code of conduct

We want This is Optimism to be a welcoming, safe and inclusive experience for everyone.

For that reason we expect everyone attending the event – attendees, speakers, partners and volunteers – to treat one another respectfully, regardless of their gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, ethnicity, religion, or software preferences.

It also means we won't tolerate any form of harassment. If you notice or experience any form of harassment, please don’t hesitate to contact us. Your concerns will be treated with respect and confidentially. 

So we’re all clear, harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. 

We expect anyone we ask to stop harassing behaviour to comply immediately. We have the right to take suitable action, ranging from a warning to expelling the offender from the event without a refund.

The staff from This is Optimism are no exception to these rules. If you wish to raise a complaint about any of us, please firstly raise it with another member, before approaching us.

In short, be kind, tolerant and remember that every one of us has a different lived experience. After all, that’s also what makes life wonderful.
