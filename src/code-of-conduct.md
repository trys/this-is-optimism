# Code of conduct

We want This is Optimism to be a welcoming, safe and inclusive experience for everyone.

For that reason we expect everyone attending the event – attendees, speakers, partners and volunteers – to treat one another respectfully, regardless of their gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, ethnicity, religion, or software preferences.

It also means we won't tolerate harassing behaviour of any kind. If you notice or experience any form of harassment, please don’t hesitate to contact [alis@ber.st](mailto:alis@ber.st). Your concerns will be treated confidentially and with respect.

So we’re all clear, harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

We expect immediate compliance when we ask someone to stop harassing behaviour. We also have the right to take appropriate action, which could include issuing a warning or ejecting the offender from the event without a refund.

The staff from This is Optimism are no exception to these rules. If you wish to raise a complaint about any of us, please talk to one of the Berst team.

Simply put, practice kindness, tolerance, and celebrate our unique experiences.

Thank you,
The Berst Team.
