Emily Macaulay is the founder of [Stanley James Press](https://www.stanleyjamespress.com/), a small design company specialising in the design and production of printed goods. The majority of her work involves helping artists, photographers and organisations design printed materials, bespoke books and exhibition spaces. She is passionate about the more unusual and complicated forms of print, creating work that engages audiences and experiments with different ways to produce things. She is also trying to find ways to be more sustainable and is constantly trying to understand the processes involved in the outcomes she produces in order to advise her clients to produce more environmentally considered products.

When she is not designing books or exhibition spaces, she can be found exploring the UK countryside on foot, turning what she finds into hiking maps and guides as one half of the map-making company [This Way](https://www.this-way.co/).
