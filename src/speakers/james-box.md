James is an author and design industry OAP. He co-founded Berst in 2019 with James Bates, his long-term collaborator. Together, they continue to pursue their belief that invention is a largely untapped source of rapid progress.

Prior to Berst, he was Design Director at pioneering studio Clearleft, where he built one of the country’s leading design teams and helped curate some of Europe’s most successful design events. He also co-authored the best-selling book Undercover UX Design and has spoken at design events all over the world.

Alongside his friend and colleague Alis Cox, he's curated This is Optimism and, unfortunately for you, will be the host for the day.
