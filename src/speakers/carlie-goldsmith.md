Carlie is a Senior Policy Advisor at Impetus, identifying and seizing opportunities for influencing public policy to improve the outcomes of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.

She is also co-founder and spokesperson for Class Divide, a campaign based in Brighton and Hove dedicated to making the systemic changes needed to reduce education inequalities between children from low-income and working-class backgrounds and their more affluent counterparts.

She is a contributor to the multi-award nominated podcast, Class Divide, and delivers awareness-raising sessions for schools and colleges on the experience of low-income and working-class children in education and beyond.

Carlie holds a Ph.D. in Applied Social Science working as a mixed-methods social researcher and evaluator with twenty years experience of delivering high-quality projects in the fields of crime and criminal justice, health inequalities, suicide prevention, and trauma-informed practice in the private, not-for-profit, and higher education sectors.

She has presented research and evaluation findings at national and international conferences, has authored and co-authored a range of publications, and other forms of research dissemination.
