Curtis is a dedicated researcher and storyteller with a knack for uncovering the narratives of people, communities, places, and work. His mission is to inspire change, amplify positive efforts, and enable amazing outcomes by helping people notice the details that often go overlooked.

He carefully crafts outputs tailored to the specific needs of each project, which can take the form of photographs, books, films, exhibitions, events, and multi award nominated podcast series.

Curtis co-founded and volunteers for Class Divide, a grassroots campaign that successfully changed education policy in Brighton & Hove. This pioneering policy, a first in England and Wales, gives children on Free School Meals priority in school admissions, reducing socio-economic segregation in the city's state schools. Curtis and Carlie are optimistically trying to turn Brighton and Hove into the best place to go to school if you are from a disadvantaged background.
