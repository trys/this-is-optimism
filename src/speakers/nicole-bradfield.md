Nicole is the Founder of Love Leading. Over the past decade she’s worked alongside the most progressive leaders looking to build inclusive cultures where different types of people enjoy making magic happen together.

She has supported organisations transitioning from traditional hierarchical structures to flat, self managed ways of working. Helped creative agencies liberate themselves to price on value instead of time. And partnered with inspiring leadership teams as they turn their back on command and control and re-write the rules of leadership for the best of humanity.

Most recently she’s been part of a learning community exploring beyond white supremacy cultures - understanding how tackling cultural traits such as fear of open conflict, defensiveness and denial and right to comfort are fundamental as we challenge dominant white culture and create the truly inclusive organisations we need right now.

She’s also a cold water swimming bore, dog nut and a super proud Brightonian.
