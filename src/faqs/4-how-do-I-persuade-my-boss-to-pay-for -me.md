We’re biased but also confident that attending This is Optimism will directly benefit both your professional growth and your organisation’s success. You’ll walk away with fresh perspectives and make connections with inspiring thinkers, both of which can encourage new creative thinking in your workplace.

In a true act of optimism, after the event we recommend you offer to share what you learn with your colleagues and see if you can infect others with your new ideas.
