title: Who is organising this?

This is Optimism has been organised by James, James, and Katie from [Berst](https://ber.st). We’re part of a small strategic design studio based in Brighton who specialise in helping scale-ups get back to innovating and break through to new stages of growth.

As designers and entrepreneurs, we know that optimism is somewhat of a prerequisite for our work. However, through our experience with clients, we’ve seen the value it brings to all areas of a business and to society as a whole. For years, we’ve hoped to attend a conference that explores optimism in all its shapes and forms. So, when we couldn’t find one, we decided to create it ourselves.

This is our first event at Berst, but we’ve had plenty of experience curating and running design conferences in the past, as well as speaking at and attending many others. We’ve taken the lessons learned from all of those and applied them to This is Optimism. Our goal is to spark a groundswell of optimism — one that gives others permission to think more creatively about the futures we can and should build. And have fun doing it.
