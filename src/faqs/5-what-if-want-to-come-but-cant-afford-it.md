While we need to cover costs to deliver the event, we don’t want money to be the reason someone misses out on This is Optimism. If you truly can’t afford the ticket price, email us at [hello@ber.st](mailto:hello@ber.st) and we will arrange a discounted or even free ticket through our scholarship program.
