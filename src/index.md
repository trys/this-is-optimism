# A tiny, one-day conference in the Sussex countryside for 100 people who want to invent better futures.

This year we’re exploring [Kevin Kelly’s belief](https://x.com/kevin2kelly/status/459723553642778624?lang=en-GB) that 'over the long term, the future is decided by optimists'.

Agree? Not sure? We’re inviting some brilliant people to help you decide. You’ll hear from designers, storytellers and neuroscientists while enjoying the beautiful surroundings of the [Artelium Wine Estate](https://www.artelium.com/). 

Come along, meet nice people, enjoy good food and some thought-provoking conversations. And a tombola.
