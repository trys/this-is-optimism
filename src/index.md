# An intimate one-day conference for 100 ambitious change-makers who wholeheartedly believe that humans can imagine and create radically better futures

Inspired by [Kevin Kelly’s notion](https://x.com/kevin2kelly/status/459723553642778624?lang=en-GB) that ‘over the long term, the future is decided by optimists’, we’re bringing together a [unique group of speakers](/speakers) to explore optimism from diverse perspectives.

If you want be inspired about our future on this planet, This is Optimism is for you. You’ll be spending the day with like-minded folks from various backgrounds: product people, founders, investors, designers, strategists and self-confessed ‘policy wonks’. Join us for a one-of-a-kind experience — and have conversations that just might change the future: yours and ours.

At the beautiful [Artelium Wine Estate](/venue) in the Sussex countryside, you’ll [enjoy wonderful food](/food) from award-winning chef Hannah Thomas, vineyard tours and tastings by Artelium’s founders. Plus a few other surprises that we’re keeping up our sleeves.

And yes, there will be a tombola.
