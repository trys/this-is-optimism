# A tiny, one-day conference in the Sussex countryside for 100 people who want to invent better futures.

This year we’re exploring [Kevin Kelly’s belief](https://x.com/kevin2kelly/status/459723553642778624?lang=en-GB) that ‘over the long term, the future is decided by optimists’.

Agree? Not sure? We’re inviting some [brilliant people](/speakers) to help you decide. Among others, you’ll hear from designers, storytellers and neuroscientists while enjoying the beautiful surroundings of the [Artelium Wine Estate](/venue). 

Come along, meet nice people, [enjoy good food](/food) and some thought-provoking conversations. And a tombola.
