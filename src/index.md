# An intimate one-day conference for 100 ambitious change-makers who share our belief that humans will imagine and invent radically better futures.

Inspired by [Kevin Kelly’s notion](https://x.com/kevin2kelly/status/459723553642778624?lang=en-GB) that ‘over the long term, the future is decided by optimists’, we are assembling [a unique, eclectic group of speakers](/speakers) to explore optimism from a diverse range of perspectives.  

This is Optimism is designed for anyone seeking inspiration about building more equitable futures. Among others, you’ll hang out with product people, founders, investors, designers, strategists and self-confessed ‘policy wonks’. Come along and be part of the conversation on change and have some fun doing it.

Hosted at the beautiful [Artelium Wine Estate](/venue) in the Sussex Countryside, attendees will [enjoy wonderful food](/food) from award winning chef Hannah Thomas, vineyard tours and tasting from Artelium’s founders plus a few other surprises we’re keeping up our sleeves until the day.

And yes, there will be a tombola.
