# Food

Our food on the day comes courtesy of [Bakestone](https://www.bakestone.uk/), founded by Hannah Thomas.

Based in the South Downs, Bakestone celebrates the seasons, gathering local, sustainably-farmed provisions to create memorable culinary experiences. They cook naturally and thoughtfully to reflect the time and space, paying attention to detailed flavour and trends. They take high-quality ingredients, cook from scratch and bring them to you crafted with care.

Hannah is an intuitive, self-taught chef who has gained her experience through hosting her own events and working in various kitchens across the country. Notable experiences include working at a beachside fish & open fire restaurant and more recently a weekly baking, menu planning, and monthly wood fire supper club at the Kinsbrook vineyard.

Bakestone make special events come to life and we canâ€™t wait to feast with them.
