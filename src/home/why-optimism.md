## Why Optimism?

We are at an especially important moment. The cost of innovation has never been lower. The gap between idea and execution keeps shrinking. And, over the next few ~~years~~ months, lots of unusually powerful technology is going to be built.

But, somewhat paradoxically, new ideas and groundbreaking discoveries are on the wane, the frequency of new patents on the decline (unless you’re in China) and the dominant narrative seems to be one of cultural pessimism.

If, as we do, you believe humans are capable of much more, we’d love for you to join us at the inaugural This is Optimism. It’s a one-day gathering for those who recognise that better futures are undoubtedly possible and are ready to commit to making them a reality.
