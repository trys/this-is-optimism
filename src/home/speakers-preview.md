## Our speakers

We’ve brought together a very special collection of inspiring thinkers and speakers who share our belief (and Kevin Kelly’s) that ‘over the long term, the future is changed by optimists.’ 

Together, we’ll explore how to harness the power of optimism to imagine, invent, and build entirely new ideas, products and businesses. We’ll also set out to prove that, despite what your 1980s-influenced cross-processed photo filters might promise you, the future has so much more to offer than the past.
